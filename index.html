      <article>
      <p>Garlic is a widely used ingredient in many popular dishes, and although we most commonly see
          bunches of bulbs or pre-minced jars in the grocery store, many people are unfamiliar with the
           way garlic actually grows!

      <h1 id="mainHeading">Garlic Crash Course</h1>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Garlic is a flowering plant that is part of the allium genus. Allium is actually the Latin word for garlic! The English word "garlic" is derived from 
         Old English, garlÄ“ac, meaning gar (spear) and leek, as a 'spear-shaped leek'.
         Close relatives of garlic plants include onions, chives, shallots, and leek. These plants are known for their fragrant (and often considered unpleasant) smell,
          as well as their wide variety of use in foods from around the world! The part most commonly eaten is the bulb, although the flower and leaves are also edible.
          Garlic has been a staple of global cuisine since ancient times. The bulbs typically yield around 10 to 20 cloves. When the cloves are crushed, they release
          the chemical compound "allicin," which is partially responsible for garlic's strong fragrance. Allicin is often cited as being a natural antibiotic, which you may
          hear from people who eat raw garlic every morning. Research on the potential health benefits from allicin have been inconclusive.
